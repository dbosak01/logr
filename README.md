# Introduction to **logr**
<img src='man/images/logr2.png' align="left" height="138" style="margin-right:10px"/>

There are already several logging packages for R.  Why create another one? 

Because the other logging packages all have something in common: they were built
for *R package developers*.  

What is different about the **logr** package is
that it is built for *normal R users*: statisticians, analysts, researchers, 
students, teachers, business people, etc.

The **logr** package is for those people who just need a written record of their
program execution.  It is designed to be as simple as possible, yet still
produce a useful and complete log.  

There are only three steps to creating a **logr** log:

1. Open the log
2. Print to the log
3. Close the log

Now this a logging system that anyone can use!  


### Installation

The easiest way to install the **logr** package is to run the following 
command from your R console:

    install.packages("logr")


Then put the following line at the top of your script:

    library(logr)
    
For examples and usage 
information, please visit the **logr** documentation site
