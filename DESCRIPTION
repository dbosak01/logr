Title: Creates Log Files
Version: 1.3.3
Authors@R: c(
    person(given = "David",
           family = "Bosak",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "dbosak01@gmail.com"),
    person("Rikard", "Isaksson", role = "ctb"))
Description: Contains functions to help create log files.  The 
    package aims to overcome the difficulty of the base R sink() command.  The
    log_print() function will print to both the console and the file log, 
    without interfering in other write operations.
