### Errors and Warnings
**logr** will write all errors and warnings to the log.  Errors and warnings are
both written at the point they are encountered.  

### Message File \*.msg
If errors or warnings are generated, they will also be written to a separate 
file called a message file.  The message file has the same name as the log, 
but with a *.msg* extension.  The purpose of the message file is so that 
errors and warnings that occur during execution of the script can be 
observed from the file system.  The presence or absence of the *.msg* file 
will indicate whether or not the program ran clean.

### Log subdirectory /log
By default, `logr` prints the log to a subdirectory named *log*.  If that 
subdirectory does not exist, the `log_open()` function will create it.  The 
default behavior can be overridden by setting the `logdir` parameter on the
`log_open()` function to `FALSE`.
