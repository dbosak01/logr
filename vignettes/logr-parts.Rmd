## Parts of the log

#### Log Header
The log header provides an introduction to your log. The header block 
contains the path of the log file, the working directory, the name of the user,
a date-time stamp, and other useful information concerning the 
operating environment.  

#### Notes
Notes will be written to the log for every call to `log_print()`. The notes 
will follow the printing of the object, and will include a date-time stamp
and the elapsed time since the last call to `log_print()`. If the object
is of class `data.frame` the number of rows and columns will also be noted. 

#### Log Footer
The log footer concludes the log with another date-time stamp for the log
end time, and a total elapsed time for the entire script.  Note that during
batch runs or when sourcing a script, the log
footer may not be generated if the script errors. Instead, the last line of 
the log will be the error message.
